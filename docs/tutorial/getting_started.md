### 3. View Plot

Once the X and Y axes are chosen, the full plot can be viewed as seen below.

In the image, the X axis chosen was SimTime, and the Y axis chosen was Gaze Heading. This can also be seen in the title of the graph and along their respected axes.

### Second Y Axis

An option to add a second dataset along the Y axis is available. To add another Y dataset select the second Y axis option and pick a data set as seen in the image below.
